# Migration Script Generator

This project is an extension of the [Script Generator](https://github.com/DavinaLeong/Script-Generator) project [here](https://github.com/DavinaLeong/Script-Generator).

Migration Script Generator is a tool I built to improve the workflow of my colleagues. It creates CodeIgniter migration scripts with a pre-generated migration version based on the local system's date-time and exports them. It is essentially a web application that is meant to sit on your local development server like WAMP or MAMP.
